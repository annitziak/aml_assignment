# Taxonomy data

The taxonomy identifications were scraped from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) through the relevant [usage-policy-respecting](https://techdocs.gbif.org/) API.

**Format:**\
*kingdom* > *phylum* > *class* > *family* > *genus* (a.k.a *parent*) > *scientific_name* (corresponding to a single species' *id*)

> [!NOTE]  
> The resulting dataset is stored into [taxonomy.csv](./taxonomy.csv).
