# Animals' traits data

Some biological information for the 500 species in analysis was scraped from [EOL](https://www.eol.org/docs/what-is-eol) — an [USA Federal Government-founded organization](https://www.citizenscience.gov/catalog/174/#) aiming to provide "free, open, multilingual, digital access to trusted information on all known species" — through the relevant [usage-policy-respecting](https://eol.org/docs/what-is-eol/terms-of-use-for-eol-application-programming-interfaces) API. For *canonical*-based species' to EOL's ids mapping, [pages.csv](./pages.csv) was downloaded from EOL's [Open Data Portal](https://opendata.eol.org/); the remaining data were instead scraped, since the downloadable tables were not exhausitive and significant discrepancies were present with respect to the website-presented information. Over 100 traits were gathered, including both species-specific characteristics (e.g., *locomotion*, *mass*) and relational features (e.g., *prey on*, *are eaten by*). However, most traits were unreported for a given species, so the sparse dataset required massive cleaning through regular expressions and research on the biological characteristics.

> [!NOTE]  
> The resulting dataset of significative species-specific characteristics is stored into [cleaned_traits.csv](./cleaned_traits.csv); the relational features are gatherable directly from [traits.csv](./traits.csv) instead.
