## Species Analysis
You are working for an NGO and are tasked with mapping biodiversity across the world.
You have been provided with a dataset which encodes the geographic locations where different animal species have been observed.
As part of the analyses into understanding what measures can be taken to help conservation efforts, there are a number of potential questions that one might consider, including:

For any given species, where can one find them in the world?
For a given location in the world, what and how many species may be observed there?
Can you discover any interesting relationships between species? e.g. does the presence of one species in a location tell you about the possible presence of others?
Can you discover any interesting relationships between species and locations? e.g. do specific species have a preference for certain habitats.
Your goal is to take inspiration from the data analysis and machine learning algorithms we have seen in the class to create predictive models to explore questions such as, but not limited to, the ones above. The data has been processed for you in terms of train and test files already, including some additional training data if you would like to use it. Note, you should not train on the test data.
A simple script that details how to load and minimally visualise this data is also included.

Features -> habitat type, dietary etc.

## Other potential questions

How does the environmental factors on an annual basis impact the presence/absence of animals? Relationship between species and locations -> preferences 
Per category of animals, model the habitat preferences using the environmental factors (random forests or decision trees)
Clustering animals together based on location -> common characteristics of features + environmental 
Visualizations of overlapping habitats and species interaction networks.
