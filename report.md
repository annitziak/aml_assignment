Three datasets were provided, of which two were labeled as training and one test. The smaller of the training datasets, called \textit{species\_train.npz}, included sightings of 500 species with a total of \num{272037} sighting locations, while the test set \textit{species\_test.npz} contained \num{1706646} locations for the same species. The larger training dataset \textit{species\_train\_extra.npz} however, contained \num{1067592} sightings for \num{1918} different species. Both training datasets contained only positive data of species recordings, and we primarily used \textit{species\_train.npz} for the project, unless otherwise mentioned.
